The game I implemented is Space Invaders. There are three classes to note here,
which are the Poison, Square, and Bullet classes. As you may notice, the Poison
and Square classes have not been renamed from the original hw10 demo. The reason
for this is because I wasn't sure what game I was making when I first started
editing the classes and then by the time I was sure I didn't feel like I had
enough time to go through and rename everything. Sorry for that!

Aside from this, my classes are fairly simple. Poison represents the aliens in
Space Invaders, and has special methods that govern the iconic movement patterns
of Space Invaders aliens. Square represents the ship you pilot and is not noticeably
different. Bullet is a new class I made to represent the lasers you shoot, and it
is also not really notably different. And of course, all three classes extend
the GameObj class as they are all GameObjects.
